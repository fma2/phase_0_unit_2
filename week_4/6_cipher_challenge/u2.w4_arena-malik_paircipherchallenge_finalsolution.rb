# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge


# I, RJ Arena, worked on this challenge with Farheen Malik.



# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.
#
# Both input and decoded_sentence are arrays.  Input takes the original coded_message string and breaks it into indivicual alphameric elements in the array.
# decoded_sentence is likewise an array, null at first, into which the decode characters are placed as individual elements.
# cipher is a hash with a one-to-one representation of the coded character to its decoded character.  The hash is relateively inefficient from both a memory
# utilization standpoint and a search standpoint, especially since there is a functional relationship between the coded and decoded characters.
#
# Test codes run:
# Used irb to investigate coded message string breakdown
# Useed irb to asses results of (0..9).to_a and possible use of ("Ã¤".."z").to_alpha for future refactor
