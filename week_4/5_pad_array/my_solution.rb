# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself.

# DIRECTIONS
# Implement Array#pad and Array#pad!. Each method accepts a minimum size (non-negative integer) and an optional pad value as arguments.
# If the array's length is less than the minimum size, Array#pad should return a new array padded with the pad value up to the minimum size.

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Define class Array
# Define method "pad"
# Method takes parameters
