# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?

# A method with parameter array in which there will be an array of scores

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)

# The letter grade

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Create a method "get_grade" which takes "array" as the parameter
# Create variable to sum all of the scores
# Create variable "y" to divide the sum by the total number of scores
# Create if/then statements, if y >= 90, return "A" .. and so on
# End if/then method
# End "get_grade" method
